# Outliers Assistant

Your assistant for Outliers, providing additional details about your account. Before you send emails/tickets/dms, have a look at some of the values set for your account and see if it answers your questions. Your account data in your own hands (kinda). 

The extension needs a tab with Outliers open to access info, but you don't need to open one manually because the extension will open and close one quickly if needed. The permission "Read and change all your data on all websites" is required for looking through your tabs to find an existing Outliers tab and creating/closing one if none are found.
